        <h2>Our Mission</h2>

        <p>
            Our Website is designed to assist users in navigating the most popular apps both free and paid that are currently available.
            The information is pulled from the iTunes API providing details such as author, genre, cost, ratings and description. From the
            home page a user can click on the image of an app from a selection of popular apps and it will bring them to the details page.
            There is also a search function where any app that is available in the iTunes app store can be chosen and details will be displayed.
            There is a dashboard page that displays app store level metrics. The design followed a bootstrap style.
